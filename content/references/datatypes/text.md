CedarDB's `text` data type stores string data.
We consider all strings as Unicode in UTF-8 encoding.
In addition to the unconstrained `text` data type, we support standard SQL blank-padded 
`char(length)`, and length constrained `varchar(length)`.

Usage example:
```sql
create table example (
    gender char(1),
    description text
);
insert into example
    values ('‚öß', repeat('UwU', 100)),
           ('X', '''Hi''');
select * from example;
```

```
 gender | description 
--------+-------------
 ‚öß      | UwUUwU...
 X      | 'Hi'
(2 rows)
```


Character lengths in CedarDB are specified in *Unicode code points*.

```sql
select length('üçç'), char_length('üçç'), octet_length('üçç');
```

```
 length | char_length | octet_length 
--------+-------------+--------------
      1 |           1 |            4
(1 row)
```

In addition, all strings need to be valid UTF-8 sequences, i.e., it is not possible to store
arbitrary binary data in string columns without additional encoding.
For such data, consider using `bytea`.
The maximum *byte length* for strings is 4&nbsp;GiB.
For compatibility to existing systems, conversions from `char` to `text` strips trailing
blank-padded spaces.

## Performance Considerations
Text and length-constrained string data types are handled equivalently.
Strings with explicit length do not provide performance or storage benefits.
Thus, we generally recommend against length-constraining string columns.

One exception is `char(1)`, which is often used as an enum value.
Therefore, we store it as a four-byte integer, i.e., one full Unicode code point.

Independent of length-constraints, CedarDB stores short strings of up to 12&nbsp;Bytes
inline, whereas larger strings need an indirection.
Short strings therefore have significant performance advantages.

## Unicode Collation Support

[Unicode collations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation) allow comparisons of string data.
In the default collation, strings are ordered lexicographically byte-by-byte by their UTF-8 encoding.

For example, a case-insensitive collate can be useful for text comparison:
```sql
with strings(a, b) as (
   values ('foo', 'FOO')
)
select a, b, a = b, a collate "en_US_ci" = b
from strings;
```

```
  a  |  b  | ?column? | ?column? 
-----+-----+----------+----------
 foo | FOO | f        | t
(1 row)
```


In addition, the expected ordering of diacritics can also depend on the collate:
```sql
with strings(s) as (
   values ('cote'),
          ('cot√©'),
          ('c√¥te'),
          ('c√¥t√©')
)
select s from strings order by s;
```

```
  s
------
 cote
 cot√©
 c√¥te
 c√¥t√©
(4 rows)
```


```sql
select s from strings order by s collate "fr_CA";
```

```
  s
------
 cote
 c√¥te
 cot√©
 c√¥t√©
(4 rows)
```
