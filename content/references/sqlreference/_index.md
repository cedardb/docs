CedarDB supports a large set of powerful SQL features.
This allows you to write declarative queries that are independent of the data storage and benefit from CedarDBs
advanced execution system.

Here are some high-level topics that go over the typical uses of the database query language:

* [Queries](queries) (`select from where`)
* [Transaction begin/end/rollback](transaction)
* [Data Management](statements/insert) (`insert into`)
* [Schema Management](statements/createtable) (`create table`)

You can also find a complete reference of CedarDBs supported query language:
* [Statements](./statements)
* [Expressions](./expressions)
* [Functions](./functions)
