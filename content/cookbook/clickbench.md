`ClickBench` is a popular benchmark for analytical database systems
[maintained by ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/).
ClickBench compares about 50 different database systems with a workload of relatively simple analytical queries.
There is a ranking dashboard with results hosted at [benchmark.clickhouse.com](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/).

## Loading the Dataset

The ClickBench dataset consists of a single wide table of real-world web traffic analysis data, including several
string columns with Unicode strings.
ClickHouse hosts the official dataset in several formats.
In the following, we will use the TSV data, which follows the default PostgreSQL conventions.
You can download the dataset like so:

```shell
curl -O https://datasets.clickhouse.com/hits_compatible/hits.tsv.gz
gzip -d hits.tsv.gz
```

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The compressed tarball is about 16&nbsp;GB to download, which decompresses to about 70&nbsp;GB of plain text.
After importing into CedarDB, the database will be about 33&nbsp;GB.
{{< /callout >}}

After downloading, you can create the schema with its 104 columns and load the TSV data into a database:

## Running the Queries

While the ClickBench dataset is realistic, the queries that run on it are less so.
Most of the queries are simplistic, and only perform a full table scan on 27 of the >100 total columns.
Because of the simple nature of these queries, they are often limited by I/O and memory bandwidth, rather than by the
processing power of your system.

A good example of a realistic query is Q7, which ranks traffic by `advengineid`, presumably to determine which
ad engine works best:

```sql
select advengineid, count(*)
from hits
where advengineid <> 0
group by advengineid
order by count(*) desc;
```

However, some other queries return nonsensical results like `avg(userid)`, `sum(advengineid)`, or meaningless
redundant expressions like: `sum(resolutionwidth + 1), sum(resolutionwidth + 2), sum(resolutionwidth + 3), ...`.

{{% /details %}}

You can run the queries on your own setup with [`psql`](/docs/clients/psql), which supports tracking the time it takes
to execute a query using the built-in `\timing` command.
The ClickBench website shows the results as a minimum of three runs, which you can measure with the following bash script:

```shell
for i in {1..3}; do
   psql -h /tmp -U postgres -c '\timing' -c "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT UserID) FROM hits;" | grep 'Time';
done
```

### Results

Now let's also do a full run with all queries and report the total time:

```shell
cat <(echo '\\timing') queries.sql | psql -h /tmp -U postgres | grep 'Time' | awk '{print "Q" NR-1 " " $0; sum += $2;} END {print "Total: " sum " ms = " NR*60000/sum " qpm";}'
```

```

The results shown here were measured on a laptop with an Intel i7-13700H CPU, which is roughly comparable to
the `c6a.4xlarge` results from the dashboard.

If you want to compare performance to a wider variety of hardware, Phoronix has a number of results for ClickHouse on
OpenBenchmarking.org:
https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/clickhouse  
Their results use the [geometric mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean) for queries per minute (qpm).
You can use the following command to get comparable qpm numbers.

```shell
cat <(echo '\\timing') queries.sql | psql -h /tmp -U postgres | grep 'Time' | awk '{sum += log($2);} END {print "Geometric mean: " exp(1)^(sum/NR) " ms = " 60000/exp(1)^(sum/NR) " qpm ";}'
```

```
Geometric mean: 197.884 ms = 303.208 qpm
```

## Closing Thoughts

Unfortunately, ClickBench does not verify the results for correctness.
For CedarDB, we have validated the all results against PostgreSQL and DuckDB.
For other systems, the comparison is unfortunately not *apples to apples*, as the systems sometimes calculate
subtly different results.

For example, ClickHouse defaults to less expensive narrow data types, which
can [overflow](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/issues/49) in some queries.
Similarly, for the `length(string)` function, ClickHouse uses the cheaper but inaccurate
[byte length](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/string-functions#length) instead of the
Unicode character length.
