title: System Table Compatibility
weight: 93
---

Besides compatibility with the PostgreSQL [SQL dialect and protocol](../sql_features), CedarDB also supports a large
part of the PostgreSQL system table catalog in the `pg_catalog` schema.
These system tables contain information about the *system* state in the form of metadata.
This metadata is often used by external tools and clients to interact with the database system for introspection and
reflection, e.g., to show which tables exist.

This page provides an overview of the currently supported system tables and views.

- 🟢 **Supported**
- 🟡 **Stubbed for compatibility**: These do not contain actual content and exist solely for compatibility purposes, as CedarDB does not share PostgreSQL's codebase or internal architecture
- 🔴 **Not yet supported**

Additionally, CedarDB exposes information that are not available in PostgreSQL in its CedarDB system tables.

## System Tables

System tables provide a raw view into the state of the database system.
In contrast to PostgreSQL, system tables in CedarDB are *read-only*, and can only be indirectly influenced through
[DDL statements](/docs/references/objects/).

System tables often contain many low-level details.
For more accessible and friendly access to the same information, consider using the
built-in [system views](#system-views), or the SQL-standard [information schema](#information-schema).

### CedarDB System Tables

CedarDB provides additional information in its system-specific system tables.
As the PostgreSQL system tables, those system tables are *read-only*.

#### cedardb_compression_info

This system table contains information about how tables and columns are compressed in CedarDB.
Note that CedarDB can use different compression schemes within the same column and that this table currently only includes statistics on cold data.

## System Views

System views provide convenient access to system information.
System tables often contain numeric identifiers, e.g., for the owner of tables.
The views instead use more human-readable symbolic names.

### CedarDB System Views

#### cedardb_compression_infos

This system view gives an easier usable representation of the compression ratio of the entries in the `cedardb_compression_info` system table.

## Information Schema

The `information_schema` is a standardized, cross-database schema that allows portable system introspection.
For compatibility, CedarDB follows
the [PostgreSQL Information Schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/information-schema.html),
which matches the [ISO/IEC 9075-11](https://www.iso.org/standard/76586.html) standard.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The information schema views are *not* included in the default search path, so queries on it need to use the
fully qualified name:

```sql
select * from information_schema.tables;
```

{{< /callout >}}
