This page contains the installation instructions and release notes for CedarDB.
We recommend always upgrading to the latest version at release.

You have two options for running CedarDB: as a standalone binary or in Docker.
- [**Docker (recommended):**](#docker) This method offers several convenience features, including automated database upgrades and parameterized user initialization. If you're using macOS, Docker is required.
- [**Standalone binary:**](#standalone) Use this if you're in an environment without Docker or just want to experiment with the interactive SQL shell.

### Activate your enterprise license

To activate your license within a Docker container, itâ€™s recommended to pass the license key using an additional enviornment flag during the `docker run` command.
```Shell
-e LICENSE_KEY='<your_key>'
```

For example, you can start your container with an active license like this:
```Shell
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 -e CEDAR_PASSWORD=test -e LICENSE_KEY='<your_key>' --name cedardb_test cedardb

### Activate your enterprise license

To activate your license, it's recommended to set the license key using the following environment variable at startup.

Note: This SQL setting is not persisted across database restarts.

Congratulations, you are now running CedarDB!
From here, either dig in with your own datasets, e.g., [imported from PostgreSQL](/docs/cookbook/importing_from_postgresql), or start with one of our [example datasets](/docs/example_datasets).


{{% callout type="warning" %}}
CedarDB releases are still in alpha, and some releases will break with the old database file format. To ensure a smooth upgrade process, please keep track of your DDL statements to re-create your schema if necessary.
