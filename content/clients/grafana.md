CedarDB is compatible with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), the popular dashboard building solution. You can use Grafana's PostgreSQL connector to visualize the data stored in CedarDB.


## Set up Grafana

{{% steps %}}

### Install Grafana

Install Grafana according to its official documentation.
For example, if you are using Ubuntu, use [this guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/).

### Start the Grafana server

Again, use the [corresponding page of the official documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/start-restart-grafana/).


### Make sure everything works

Use [this page](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/) of Grafana's documentation to test your installation and ensure it set it up correctly.

### Optional: reduce refresh interval
By default, Grafana refreshes its dashboard at most once every 5 seconds. 


If you want to update your dashboards more often, open `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` in your favorite text editor:
```ini
min_refresh_interval = 100ms
```

Afterwards, restart Grafana to load the setting:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

You can then choose your own refresh intervals within your dashboard: Within your dashboard's setting menu, under the general tab, set the Auto refresh setting to e.g. `100ms,200ms,500ms,1s,5s,10s,30s,1m,5m`.

## Set up CedarDB
Now that Grafana is up and running, we have to start a CedarDB instance it can connect to. 

{{< callout type="info" >}}

In this example, we're assuming an empty database. If you already have a CedarDB database instance containing data, modify the following steps accordingly.

{{< /callout >}}

{{% steps %}}

### Start CedarDB

```shell
./server -createdb /home/dbs/grafanatest --address=:: # or omit 'createdb' if you already created the database earlier
```

### Connect via psql and create a Grafana user

Connect to CedardB via [psql](/docs/clients/psql):

```shell
psql -h /tmp -U postgres
```

Create a new user for Grafana:

```sql
create user grafana;
alter user grafana with password 'grafana';
create database grafana;
\c grafana -- switch to the grafana database. Re-run this if you have to reconnect with psql later on.
```

### Create and populate a schema

Let's create some dummy data so we can see Grafana in action:

```sql
create table test(time timestamptz, value int);
insert into test values(current_timestamp, (random() * 100)::int);
\watch 1 -- this command re-executes the last command every second - we now get live updates!
```

## Build a dashboard in Grafana

{{% steps %}}

### Add a new data source
Within Grafana (e.g. on https://localhost:3000/), navigate to: Main Menu > Connections > Data sources > Add new data source

Choose "PostgreSQL", and fill in the following settings:



```
Name: cedardb
Host URL: localhost:5432
Database name: grafana
Username: grafana
Password: grafana

TSL/SSL Mode: disable
PostgreSQL Version: 15
Min time interval: 100ms 
```

Then click on "Save & test". You will get an error message "Internal Server Error" with the message `ERROR:   schema "information_schema" does not exist` in the CedarDB logs. This is expected behaviour and fine for now. 

### Build a dashboard

On the top right of the data source window, click on "Build a dashbaord", and then "Add visualization". Choose your new "CedarDB" data source.

In the Query builder, toggle the "Code" view on the far right and enter the statement
```sql
select * from test;
```

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
The interactive query builder is currently not supported, as it relies on database instrospection features that CedarDB does not support yet. 
{{< /callout >}}


When choosing the correct interval (e.g., "Last 10 minutes") you should see an automatically updating live view of your data. Apply the changes on the top right to get a view of your new dashboard.

### Fiddle with the refresh intervals
If you have changed the minimum refresh interval of Grafana earlier, you can set the auto refresh interval in the top right to a lower value (e.g., 100ms). Rerun your `watch` command in your psql shell:

```sql
insert into test values(current_timestamp, (random() * 100)::int);
\watch 0.05
```
to get a more responsive Grafana.

## Next Steps

Use more sophisticated data (maybe from on of our [sample datasets](/docs/example_datasets/)?) or take a look at the [Grafana docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/) to see which kinds of visualization are possible.
